# Search locations

Search some locations on the map, using latitude and longitude.

Using the open-source JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and the free wiki world map [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

This project is just some easy implementation, using the coordinates to search on the map.
