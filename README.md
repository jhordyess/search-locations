# Search locations

Search some locations on the map, using latitude and longitude.

Using the open-source JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and the free wiki world map [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

This project is just some easy implementation, using the coordinates to search on the map.

Share your location to locate yourself on the map.(Optional)

A circle is drawn on the map, use the scrollbar or text input field to change the radius.

See online: [https://jhordyess.github.io/search-locations/](https://jhordyess.github.io/search-locations/)

To do: To use SI units in the radius input field, but may come with ReactJS. ðŸ¤“
