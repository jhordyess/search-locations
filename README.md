# Search locations

Search some locations on the map, using latitude and longitude.

## Description

This project leverages the power of the open-source JavaScript library `Leaflet` and the vast resources of [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to help you search for locations effortlessly.

You can also choose to share your current location on the map (optional).

Simply adjust the circle on the map's radius using the scrollbar or text input field. The circle's radius is measured in meters.
